The data included in the file 'earthquake_data.csv' provide the results of the survey conducted 
on people on various questions connected with the topic of earthquakes. 
The questions were:
- "In general, how how worried are you about earthquakes?",
- "How worried are you about the Big One, a massive, catastrophic earthquake?",
- "Do you think the ""Big One"" will occur in your lifetime?",
- "Have you ever experienced an earthquake?",
- "Have you or anyone in your household taken any precautions for an earthquake 
(packed an earthquake survival kit, prepared an evacuation plan, etc.)?",
- "How familiar are you with the San Andreas Fault line?",
- "How familiar are you with the Yellowstone Supervolcano?",

The additional data we asked for were:
- Age (divided into several ranges),
- Gender (We assumed only Male and Female),
- How much total combined money did all members of your HOUSEHOLD earn last year?
- US Region

These data stand for the base of the way of how the all data will be subsequently
processed and ordered.
