The database earthquakes.csv includes the answers of the responses, who took part in a poll on 
'Worry about the earthquakes'. In this documents the data were processed and visualized using 
different methods I considered most suitable according to this type of data.

The folder Original Data consists of the copy of the raw data imported in two formats: a '.csv' 
file and a '.txt' file. Moreover, there is a text file 'The Metadata Guide' in which we can find
the description of those data and the way there were collected.

The folder Documents includes the Data Appendix, where we can find a definition of the variables
we used to process our data and some graphs or charts that can visualize the basic information of
what we can find during reviewing this data. Here we can also find the final paper of our work, 
that is a '.pdf' file ready to prinst and present the results

The folder Analysis Data includes several Jupyter Notebook files, where we have the results of 
processing our data and searching for particular information. 

For all of the processing of the data I used the Jupyter Notebook compatible with the PyCharm 
Professional 2022.2.3 environment.
