The database earthquakes.csv includes the answers of the responses, who took part in a poll on 
'Worry about the earthquakes'. In this documents the data were processed and visualized using 
different methods I considered most suitable according to this type of data.

The folder Original Data consists of the copy of the raw data imported in two formats: a '.csv' 
file and a '.txt' file. Moreover, there is a text file 'The Metadata Guide' in which we can find
the description of those data and the way there were collected.

The folder Documents includes the Data Appendix, where we can find a definition of the variables
we used to process our data and some graphs or charts that can visualize the basic information of
what we can find during reviewing this data. Here we can also find the final paper of our work, 
that is a '.pdf' file ready to prinst and present the results

The folder Analysis Data includes several Jupyter Notebook files, where the results of 
processing our data are stored. Each file consists of a few different functions used to display 
particular information. 

The file 'Supervolcano.ipynb' focuses on outlining the answers to the question: 'How familiar are
you with the Yellowstone Supervolcano'. The data is groupped by the place of residence of the respondent.
It also highlights which answer was the most frequent for each salary range.

The file 'Experience.ipynb' displays the most common responses for the question 'Have you ever experienced
an earthquake' sorted by the region of the USA where they live. Additionally each answer for each region is 
counted, so that we can easily observe which places are more vulnerable for such dangerous events.

The file 'Worry.ipynb' includes responses for the questions: 'In general, how worried are you about the
earthquakes' and 'How worried are you about the Big One'. The results are divided into tables based on
the year salary of the interviewee. In this case we can notice how people of different wealth levels are
afraid of such natural disasters.

The file 'Big_one.ipynb' processes the answers to the question: 'Do you think that a Big One will occur in
your lifetime?' groupped by gender and age range of the respondent. Each response then is counted and we can 
notice which answer was the most frequent for each age range.

For all of the processing of the data I used the Jupyter Notebook compatible with the PyCharm 
Professional 2022.2.3 environment.
